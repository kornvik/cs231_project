# Code for Pile Penetration Depth Estimation using 3d CV techniques
The techniques include classical CV methods such as optical flow, ML related techniques including segmentation and feature point detection using DOPE mode. And lastly kalman filter (WIP).

## Data source

1. Download you can download video.zip from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1buvw2SAH0mHDW_G-bmm7Y2XeSQVAug-c?usp=sharing for pile scene
2. Generate the pile images from blender using pile.blend
3. In case you want to test with animated scene generated rendered video from animation.blend

## How to run

1. `python opflow_with_target.py`
